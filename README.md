# Neural-Talk-2 with augmented input data

This is a modified version of Neural Talk 2 by Karpathy. The goal is trying to improve sentence accuracy by randomly cropping, i.e paying attention to different random portion of the picture and learn differrent set of features. These feature sets are combined and finally fed into rNN for decoding sentences.
